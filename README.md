Some apps have been made through "Script Editor.app" and others through "Automator.app", both come preinstalled with macOS. 

<h2>How to differentiate between them?</h2>
The apps made through Automator have an icon same as the Automator.<br>
Apps with the other icon have been made through the Script Editor.

<h2>How to edit these .app files?</h2>
<ol>
<li>For an Automator app, launch Automator.app and for a Script Editor app, launch scipt editor.</li>
<li>Press command+O to open an existing document.</li>
<li>Select the app you want to edit.</li>
