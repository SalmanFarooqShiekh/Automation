Some apps have been made through "Script Editor.app" and others through "Automator.app", both come preinstalled with macOS. 

<h2>How to differentiate between them?</h2>
The apps made through Automator have an icon same as the Automator.
Apps with the other icon have been made through the Script Editor.
